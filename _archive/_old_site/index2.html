    Overview
    
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>
    
    My
    
    
    
    site
    
    
    
    is
    
    
    
    twenty
    
    
    
    years
    
    
    
    old.
    
    
    
    Realizing
    
    
    
    that
    
    
    
    started
    
    
    
    me
    
    
    
    thinking
    
    
    
    about
    
    
    
    the
    
    
    
    next
    
    
    
    twenty.
    
    
    
    The
    
    
    
    perspective
    
    
    
    shift
    
    
    
    changed
    
    
    
    the
    
    
    
    way
    
    
    
    I
    
    
    
    think
    
    
    
    making
    
    
    
    and
    
    
    
    maintaining
    
    
    
    sites.

  <p>
    
    Generally
    
    
    
    speaking,
    
    
    
    I&#x27;ll
    
    
    
    be
    
    
    
    writing
    
    
    
    vanilla
    
    
    
    HTML,
    
    
    
    CSS,
    
    
    
    and
    
    
    
    JavaScript.
    
    
    
    I&#x27;ll
    
    
    
    write
    
    
    
    more
    
    
    
    about
    
    
    
    that
    
    
    
    elsewhere.
    
    
    
    For
    
    
    
    now,
    
    
    
    it&#x27;s
    
    
    
    enough
    
    
    
    to
    
    
    
    say
    
    
    
    frameworks
    
    
    
    have
    
    
    
    been
    
    
    
    a
    
    
    
    net
    
    
    
    negative
    
    
    
    for
    
    
    
    me.
    
    
    
    I&#x27;m
    
    
    
    bowing
    
    
    
    out
    
    
    
    of
    
    
    
    that
    
    
    
    game.
