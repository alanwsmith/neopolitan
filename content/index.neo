A plain-text format to build my site

Overview

My site is twenty years old. Realizing that
started me thinking about the next twenty. The 
perspective shift changed the way I think 
making and maintaining sites.

Generally speaking, I'll be writing vanilla HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. I'll write more about that
elsewhere. For now, it's enough to say frameworks 
have been a net negative for me. I'm bowing out 
of that game.
