Custom Shorthand Tags

Shorthand tags look like

-- code/

<<span|alfa|bravo|charlie: delta>>

-- /code

There are not specified custom tags. Defining
and using them is an implementaiton detail. 
TODO: There are recommended examples in
the reference templates


-- todo

[] Section names for the category types
are reserved words that go to their 
type to ensure that all types
have sections associated with them. 
(That is, it's required to have output
for the section categories. There is
no expectation for what the output
should be. Just that the templates exist)

[] Define the characters that get escaped
when escaping happens. 

[] Create template the outputs the section
for rebuilding sections. 

[] Write up the fact that flags are required
to be output in order for redoing this 
format. Attributes are not required to
be in the same order they showed up in
the source when rebuilding it. 

[] Create a default formatter. Allow
line length to be set. TBD on what
else (aim to keep it at a minimum)

[] Implicit in the specs is the required 
``-- neopolitan`` section which transforms 
the contents without adding anything extra 
to it. Section attributes and flags are ignored. 
This is the only required section. 

[] Make ``-- metadata`` a reserved section name
that should not be output to the page. 
The attrs it has are implementation details. 
Having an metadata section is not required
though. Possible feature for future versions
is to allow JSON or YAML to be used for
the body and pulled in. In that light, 
the ``-- type:`` attribute is a reserved
word. Eventually, will have possible values
of ``neopolitan``, ``json``, ``yaml``.
Other formats TBD.


[] Make ``-- template: `` be part of the 
section ref, but not spec. (since
there isn't a defined spec for sections)

[] Make ``-- id: `` and ``-- class: `` be
section ref. 

[] Make ``template:`` be part of the
shorthand ref. 

[] Spec is to fall back to ``<NAME>``
for any ``<<NAME>>`` tag that doesn't
match a template. It's always open
and close. 

[] Reference should include standard
elements for spans. 

[] Reference should include standard
elements for sections. 

[] Provide tests for the reference 
sections and spans for anyone
that wants to implement them to
use them as expanded test for 
other parsers?

[] Version the specs. 

[] Attribute values are only 
text spans and escaped characters? 
Or should they be full parsing? TBD
based on test usage. 

[] Image section is not required but
give guidelines about usage (re: alt text
and path handling via flag)

[] The output references should
just be sections, not the full page. 
Should be able to show them in 
the example though. Maybe
those templates are in
a "support" section that's outside
the reference templates.
