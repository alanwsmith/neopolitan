Span Flags

-- Overview

Tags and Shorthand spans accept flags. 

The parsing logic is:

-- p

Flags end at spaces, tabs, newlines
or pipes [TKTKTK: Insert pipe character]

Flags can have individual characters
that match the closing tag or shorthand
token, but they can't have two in a row
as that would be the closing indication. 

Emoji (e.g. ðŸ•º) can be used. (Recognizing
that different systems display different
images for the same emoji)

Escaping characters in flags is not 
supported. 1

Doing so would require switching 
the AST to use an array of spans to 
track the escaped characters instead of
using a single text string. That would
lead to an unacceptable increase in the
complexity of using them in templates. 

The reason spans would be required for
escape characters is so the AST can
be used to make an accurate reproduction
of the input source. 


-- footnote

Note that this means you can have
multiple opening tag tokens like:

-- code 

text|alfa&lt;&lt;bravo

-- p

Where ``alfa<<bravo`` is the flag. 
Same goes for the ``[`` and ``{``
characters for links and images.
