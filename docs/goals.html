    <h1>Incomplete Parsing</h1>
    <h2>Failed At:</h2>
    <pre>**A Single Standard Specification**

Trying to avoid all the different flavors
of Markdown parsers. Any given input
should produce the same AST regardless
of the parser^^1^^. 

- **Complete AST Specification**

- **Specific Output Specifications**

Neopolitan is designed to be as flexible
as possible. This is by making the spec
mostly focused on parsing inputs to
generate an AST. Output of the AST
is largely an implementation detail. 

However, there are a few standard outputs
specified for HTML output to aid in 
portability of files. These are defined
on the specification page. 







- **Semantic Versioning**

- **Format Stability**

I've been using Neopolitan for
a few years now. While it has evolved 
a lot during that time, it's been 
effectively stable for some time. 

The goal of 2.0 is to be as stable
as possible, but I expect a 2.0.1 with 
minor modifications to clarify behavior
of edge cases. 

There are some potential feature additions
(e.g. CSV, JSON, YAML section handling)
that would result in 2.1, 2.2 etc.
Those versions would provide backward
compatibility with prior 2.x versions. 

The goes is to never have to make
a 3.0 (i.e. something that requires
breaking changes)


-- footnote
-- id: 1

The only things that could be different 
are ``attrs`` which might appear in a 
different order. But, requiring an 
order is not part of the spec since
they are key/values pairs. The only
requirement is that all the same
keys exist with the same values
(regardless of order)
