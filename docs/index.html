</h1><p>A plain-text format for making web sites.

</p><p>It's like Markdown, but with more features.

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>Head's up: I'm in the middle of rebuilding the site.

</p><p>The examples on this home page are up to date. Most of the rest of the site is just scratch notes and TODOs. Feel free to click around if you want to see how the sausage is being made.

</p><h2>How It Works

</h2><h3>The Basics

</h3><p>Neopolitan documents are made from sections. Each one start with two dashes followed by a name. For example:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&#45;&#45; title

</p><p>A Basic Example

</p><p>This is an example of what a Neopolitan<br /> document looks like.

</p><p></div>

</p><p>The HTML output looks like this:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Basic Example<br /> &lt;/h1&gt;<br /> &lt;p&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an example of what a<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Neopolitan document looks like.<br /> &lt;/p&gt;

</p><p></div>

</p><h3>Section Flags

</h3><p>Each section can have flags. They're defined by adding lines starting with two dashes immediately follow the section like this:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&#45;&#45; h2<br /> &#45;&#45; hidden

</p><p>This H2 is hidden

</p><p></div>

</p><p>Which outputs:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&lt;h2 hidden&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;This H2 is hidden<br /> &lt;/h2&gt;

</p><p></div>

</p><h3>Section Attributes

</h3><p>Key/value attributes can be added as well. For example:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&#45;&#45; h2<br /> &#45;&#45; class: red

</p><p>This H2 is red

</p><p></div>

</p><p>Which produces:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&lt;h2 class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;This H2 is red<br /> &lt;/h2&gt;

</p><p></div>

</p><h2>Markdown Section Comparison

</h2><p>A basic Markdown document might look like this:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&#35; The Title

</p><p>Some text.

</p><p>&#35;&#35; Forward

</p><p>More text.

</p><p></div>

</p><p>A corresponding Neopolitan document would look like this:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&#45;&#45; h1

</p><p>The Title

</p><p>Some text.

</p><p>&#45;&#45; h2

</p><p>Forward

</p><p>More text.

</p><p></div>

</p><p>Each would produce:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&lt;h1&gt;The Title&lt;/h1&gt;<br /> &lt;p&gt;Some Text.&lt;/p&gt;<br /> &lt;h2&gt;Forward&lt;/h2&gt;<br /> &lt;p&gt;More Text.&lt;/p&gt;

</p><p></div>

</p><p>Neopolitan takes more lines to produce the same output. It provides no benefit if that's all you need.

</p><h2>Neopolitan Benefits

</h2><p>Neopolitan's usefulness comes from adding HTML features to content<sup>1</sup>.

</p><p>For example, changing the above demo to use explicit sections and attributes like this:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&#45;&#45; title

</p><p>The &#64;&#64;Title&#124;class: red&#64;&#64;

</p><p>Some text.

</p><p>&#45;&#45; forward<br /> &#45;&#45; class: blue<br />

</p><p>More text.

</p><p></div>

</p><p>produces this:

</p><p><div class="tmp-example">

</p><p>&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot; aria-label=&quot;Page Title&quot;&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;The &lt;span class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;<br /> &lt;/h1&gt;<br /> &lt;p&gt;Some Text.&lt;/p&gt;<br /> &lt;h2 class=&quot;forward blue&quot;&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Forward<br /> &lt;/h2&gt;<br /> &lt;p&gt;More Text.&lt;/p&gt;

</p><p></div>

</p><p>Specifically, this output does the following:

</p><p><ul class="flow"> <li> Automatically add the &quot;title&quot; class to the &quot;h1&quot; element </li> <li> Automatically add an &quot;aria-label&quot; to the &quot;h1&quot; element<sup>2</sup> </li> <li> Use a span to add a &quot;red&quot; class to the word Title in the H1. This is done with the &quot;&#64;&#64;&quot; shorthand which is described further below. The key point for this example is the ability to add styles inside headlines. </li> <li> Output an H2 with the &quot;Forward&quot; text in it without having to write the word in addition to using it as the section name<sup>3</sup>. </li> <li> Automatically add the &quot;forward&quot; class to the H2 </li> <li> Append the &quot;blue&quot; class to the H2 via the &quot;&#45;&#45; class: blue&quot; section attribute </li> </ul>

</p><p>Of course, the same output could be produced with Markdown. But, it would require falling back to raw HTML for most of it.

</p><p><hr />

</p><p><h2>Footnotes</h2>

</p><p><ol class="flow"> <li> Sure, you could always roll back to using HTML directly in your Markdown documents. </li> <li> Adding the &quot;aria-label&quot; is a bit of a contrived example. I don't know if including one in an H1 is advisable. The point here is not about the specific label. It's about the general ability to add things like aria labels during output without having to define them directly in the content itself. </li> <li> <p> The names don't have to match. You could just as easily make a section called &quot;&#45;&#45; week&quot; and have the output be &quot;The Week In Review&quot;. </p> <p> There's also no restriction limiting the output to an H2 tag. An entire structure of divs could be used the same way. </p> </li> </ol>

</p><p>Section Attribute Example

</p><p>Neopolitan documents consist of sections. They start with two dashes followed by a name (e.g. &#45;&#45; title, &#45;&#45; h2, &#45;&#45; image, etc.). Each section can have key/value attributes and flags. They also start with two dashes and look like &#96;&#96;&#45;&#45; attrKey: value&#96;&#96; and &#96;&#96;&#45;&#45; flagName&#96;&#96;.

</p><p>For example, this section has a &#96;&#96;&#45;&#45; class: red&#96;&#96; attribute. As a result, the HTML output looks like:

</p><p>&#45;&#45; code<br /> &#45;&#45; html

</p><p>&lt;h2 class=&quot;red&quot&gt;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Section Attribute Example<br /> &lt;/h2&gt;<br />

</p><p>&#45;&#45; footnote<br /> &#45;&#45; id: 1

</p><p>This is an example footnote. They are linked to the content in the document by matching the <code>&#45;&#45; id</code> attribute of the section to the corresponding <code>&#94;&#94;ID&#94;&#94;</code> shorthand in the document.

</p><h2>Documentation

</h2><h2>Custom Shorthand Tags

</h2><p>Shorthand tags look like

</p><p>There are not specified custom tags. Defining and using them is an implementaiton detail. TODO: There are recommended examples in the reference templates

</p><p>[] Section names for the category types are reserved words that go to their type to ensure that all types have sections associated with them. (That is, it's required to have output for the section categories. There is no expectation for what the output should be. Just that the templates exist)

</p><p>[] Define the characters that get escaped when escaping happens.

</p><p>[] Create template the outputs the section for rebuilding sections.

</p><p>[] Write up the fact that flags are required to be output in order for redoing this format. Attributes are not required to be in the same order they showed up in the source when rebuilding it.

</p><p>[] Create a default formatter. Allow line length to be set. TBD on what else (aim to keep it at a minimum)

</p><p>[] Implicit in the specs is the required <code>-- neopolitan</code> section which transforms the contents without adding anything extra to it. Section attributes and flags are ignored. This is the only required section.

</p><p>[] Make <code>-- metadata</code> a reserved section name that should not be output to the page. The attrs it has are implementation details. Having an metadata section is not required though. Possible feature for future versions is to allow JSON or YAML to be used for the body and pulled in. In that light, the <code>-- type:</code> attribute is a reserved word. Eventually, will have possible values of <code>neopolitan</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>yaml</code>. Other formats TBD.

</p><p>[] Should there be speced reserved words for <code>-- metadata</code>? Attrs that aren't required but are defined for what they should be? Probably makes sense to have <code>-- created:</code>, <code>-- updated:</code> be defined for the date format to use. And, <code>-- id:</code> as a recommendation for the ID of page that can be used for cross references.

</p><p>[] Make <code>-- template:</code> be part of the section ref, but not spec. (since there isn't a defined spec for sections)

</p><p>[] Make <code>-- id:</code> and <code>-- class:</code> be section ref.

</p><p>[] Make <code>template:</code> be part of the shorthand ref.

</p><p>[] Spec is to fall back to <code><NAME></code> for any <code><<NAME>></code> tag that doesn't match a template. It's always open and close.

</p><p>[] Reference should include standard elements for spans.

</p><p>[] Reference should include standard elements for sections.

</p><p>[] Provide tests for the reference sections and spans for anyone that wants to implement them to use them as expanded test for other parsers?

</p><p>[] Version the specs.

</p><p>[] Attribute values are only text spans and escaped characters? Or should they be full parsing? TBD based on test usage.

</p><p>[] Image section is not required but give guidelines about usage (re: alt text and path handling via flag)

</p><p>[] The output references should just be sections, not the full page. Should be able to show them in the example though. Maybe those templates are in a "support" section that's outside the reference templates.

</p><p>[] Note that the specific page wrapper is more example than reference, but the page template itself is ref.

</p><h2>Possible Command Line Interface

</h2><p>The first 2.0 version will only create the AST for use inside rust apps. Long term possibility of making a command line interface.

</p><p>[] Make a config loader with a JSON schema you can pass in.

</p><p>[] Output ASTs as JSONs in an output dir with the relative paths of the source files.

</p><p>[] Output ASTs as JSONs in the same directory as the source files.

</p><p>[] Provide minijinja output from the command line run.
