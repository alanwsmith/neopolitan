Command Line Interface

Introduction

</h2><p>

Version 2.0 of Neopolitan generates ASTs for use in rust apps. It does not include a command line interface. I'm considering one in the future to output ASTs as JSONs either as files or as STDOUT.

</p><p>

Adding a basic HTML output from templates is also a possibility. I'm not sure about that though as there are so many possible quality-of-life improvement decisions that it's it might not be worth doing work inside Neopolitan. Other engines (e.g. Neopoligen) are likely where that effort is better spent.
