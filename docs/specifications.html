Neopolitan 2.0.0 Specification

</h1>
  <p>

[] make 





 a defined section where the first flag is the language to use for highlighting

</p><h2>

Introduction

</h2><p>

The specification for Neopolitan 2.0.0 is test based. Any parser that passes all the test meets the specification.

</p><h2>

Test Types

</h2><p>

The specification is split into three parts.

</p>
  <p>

1. AST Generation

</p>
  <p>

2. Required Sections and Attributes

</p>
  <p>

3. HTML Output

</p><h2>

AST Generation

</h2><p>

Tests are currently built into the rust code. They include parsing for the shorthands.

</p><p>

Sections can have attrs (attributes) and flags. The flags must preserve the order from the source input. Attrs are key/value pairs with no requirement for maintaining a specific order.

</p><h2>

Reserved/Required Sections And Attributes

</h2>
  <p>

Sections

</p>
  <p>

TODO: Add details about how documents must start with a section (which means all content is in a section)

</p>
  <p>

- metadata - must not output directly on the page.

</p>
  <p>

- neopolitan - Outputs the contents of the section without adding anything beyond the content generated from the body of section. This ensures there's a way to test AST generation from a parser. (Necessary because content can't exist outside a section)

</p>
  <p>

Section Attributes

</p>
  <p>

These attributes must be handled by a parser to meet the spec. They can be used in any section.

</p>
  <p>

- 





</p>
  <p>

Value is a date in the RFC 3339 format.

</p>
  <p>

This is the way to change the output template for a section. The details of the values and their corresponding outputs is an implementation detail, but the attribute key is reserved.

</p><h2>

HTML Output

</h2><p>

Neopolitan is designed primarily to generate web content. Output is largely an implementation detail with a required exceptions designed to improve portability between systems.

</p><p>

Any generator that passes all the output tests meets the spec. Anything not defined in the tests is left as an implementation detail.

</p><p>

TODO: Write up details of 





 being reserved. It's how you can change the output if you want something other than what's speced for the shorthands.

</p><p>

TODO: Consider desciptions of how the HTML Output is representative. (e.g. systems may add extra classes, or attributes, but they should work directionally the same if any modifications are made)
