  <p>Neopoliltan Philosophies</p>
</h1><div class="note">
  <div class="noteline">note</div>
  <div class="notetext"><p>These are very much draft notes on the thoughts, influences, and decisions behind Neopolitan&#x27;s design. Things will get added deleted and changed as development continues.</p></div>
</div><h2>The Philosophies</h2>
<p>In no particular order...</p>
<h3>HTML Focused</h3>
<p>My primary output target is HTML. Most HTML tags have native counterparts to support that. If a tool doesn&#x27;t support a thing that thing doesn&#x27;t get used. I&#x27;m working to include a wide set to give us more things to play with.</p>
<h3>Footnotes And References</h3>
<p>Use the first line after them as the name which is what&#x27;s tied into the key from the content. (e.g. <code>&gt;&gt; Some Name</code> connects to `&lt;&lt;^ Some Name &gt;&gt;`. Surrounding white space is trimmed. Internal spaces are allowed but must match as the value is used as a direct key.</p>
<h3>Whitespace Is Insignificant</h3>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter in most places except for blank lines that act as separators between sections and items</p>
<h3>No Form Section</h3>
<p>I was considering a <code>-&gt; form</code> section but decided against it. Better to just roll out to an `-&gt; html` section for that based of the complexity.</p>
<h3>Sections For Styling</h3>
<p>Several sections (like <code>-&gt; note</code> and <code>-&gt; 
notes</code>) are simply alternate versions of other sections (paragraphs and lists for example). The intent it to provide different element types to make them easier to categorize and style</p>
<h3>Only One Style For Attributes</h3>
<p>I considered two types of attributes for sections. One that would go directly into the HTML and one that was for directives that would only be used for processing. For example, instead of:</p>
<div class="pre-wrapper"><div class="pre-spacer"></div><pre><code>-&gt; code
&gt;&gt; rust
&gt;&gt; class: alfa</code></pre></div><p>The <code>rust</code> line would get a separate starting token indicating that that string wouldn&#x27;t go directly to the output but was a processor instruction (which would let it know to add <code>language-rust</code> to the HTML attribute list).</p>
<p>It would have looked something like this:</p>
<div class="pre-wrapper"><div class="pre-spacer"></div><pre><code>-&gt; code
++ rust
&gt;&gt; class: alfa</code></pre></div><p>I decided against that because it would require remembering which things were directives and which weren&#x27;t. For my implementation, it&#x27;s the responsibility of the processor to make the determination.</p>
<h3>Minijinja Templates</h3>
<p>I&#x27;m using Minijinja for the template engine. This is an implementation detail that isn&#x27;t required. I&#x27;m also using the <code>.jinja</code> file extension instead of <code>.html</code>. I&#x27;m going with that because my auto-formatter kepts messing with the templates in a way that altered the spacing. I haven&#x27;t found a maintained jinja extension for neovim tree-sitter. Something to add to the list.</p>
<h3>Convenience Sections</h3>
<p>Several sections exist purely for convenience. For example, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to make a <code>-&gt; div</code> section with a <code>&gt;&gt; class: warning</code> on it, but I do that so often it&#x27;s nicer to have a <code>-&gt; warning</code> section.</p>
<p>This also goes for sections that are nothing more than aliases for standard HTML tags. For example, adding a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> with any necessary attributes is not much more work than making a <code>-&gt; textarea</code> section. But, the section keeps the look consistent with the rest of the page and I think it looks nicer than that HTML tag.</p>
<h3>Either HTML or Neopolitan</h3>
<p>You can&#x27;t put HTML in any section other than an <code class="language-neo">-&gt; html</code> section and have it work. That prevents issues with escaping and parsing characters that are meaningful in HTML (e.g. trying to determine if a <kbd>&lt;</kbd> is a literal character or the start of an HTML tag. Most HTML tags have neopolitan tags mapped to them. Anything that doesn&#x27;t or needs more nuance can be handled with an <code class="language-neo">-&gt; html</code> section. If you&#x27;re trying to do something that that doesn&#x27;t handle, you&#x27;re beyond the scope of the format.</p>
<h3>Unix Like Process Call Outs</h3>
<p>Provide a section to call out to other processes to load JSON and serialize it in. Also provide processes that return neopolitan content prior to parsing the document. And ones that return straight HTML</p>
<h3>Multiple Sites</h3>
<p>There is only one set of content but it can go to multiple sites via a <code>site</code> or <code>sites</code> attribute. (where <code>sites</code> can got to multiple output sites. Content will go to a <code class="language-directory if no">sites&#x2f;default</code>site`` or <code>sites</code> attribute is found. I set it up this way because I have multiple sites and edit content in a single location via my Grimoire. While the directory structure for the content gets mapped to the output files there isn&#x27;t a level to determine the site. That&#x27;s only done by the attributes.</p>
