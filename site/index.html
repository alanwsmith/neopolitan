      a plain-text website format


      -&gt; h2

      Overview

      My site is twenty years old. Realizing that
      started me thinking about the next twenty. The
      perspective shift changed the way I think
      making and maintaining sites.

      Generally speaking, I'll be writing vanilla HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript. I'll write more about that
      elsewhere. For now, it's enough to say frameworks
      have been a net negative for me. I'm bowing out
      of that game.

      Content management also caught my attention.
      I'm a huge fan of plain-text. My current system
      is around nine thousand Markdown, MDX, and Org-Mode
      files. They're solid formats, but each causes
      its own type of friction. For example, I don't
      use description lists because they aren't native
      to the MDX parser I'm using.

      So, I'm making my own format.

      Neopolitan Features

      The format is still in its early stages
      and very much in flux. That said, the
      basic ideas are mostly in place.


      -&gt; aside
      &gt;&gt; class: highlighted

      There's a bunch of code samples below. The
      format is more about text content. Parsing
      through collections of short samples took
      me a little getting used to.


      -&gt; list

      - My goal is not to make a document format
      that's all things to all people. It's to make
      a format that makes it quick, easy, and
      pleasurable to post on my site.

      - I'm open-sourcing the work and love the idea
      that maybe someday other folks would be
      interested but for now this is more of working
      in public thing than it is trying to launch
      a new format.

      - Neopolitan documents are composed of sections
      that start with a `-&gt;`` token followed by
      the name for the type of section. The type of
      section determines how the content is processed.
      For example, a `-&gt; title`` section turns the first
      line after it into an `h1`` and the rest of
      the content after it becomes paragraphs.

      - Optional attributes an be added to each section.
      via a token with two `&gt;`` directly under the
      opening `-&gt;`` line. The `&gt;&gt; class: highlighted``
      in the `-&gt; aside`` section above is an example.

      - Some sections are for display (like this
      `-&gt; list``) while others are for metadata
      (like the `-&gt; attributes``, and `-&gt; categories`)
      below.

      - Different inline tags are available for links,
      code, spans, quotes, etc... The tags start with
      two `&lt;`` and end with two `&gt;`` Here's a link as
      an example:


      -&gt; code
      &gt;&gt; neo

      &lt;&lt;link|https://www.example.com/|alfa text&gt;&gt;


      -&gt; list

      - Links can also use references. This is done using
      some name or number in the tag then adding the
      same thing to a `-&gt; links` section somewhere in
      the document. For example:


      -&gt; code
      &gt;&gt; neo

      &lt;&lt;link|1|bravo text&gt;&gt;


      -&gt; p

      And then in a `-&gt; links` section:


      -&gt; code
      &gt;&gt; neo

      1: https://www.example.com


      -&gt; list

      - Optional attributes can be passed to inline
      tags by separating them with a pipe. For example:


      -&gt; code
      &gt;&gt; neo

      &lt;&lt;link|charlie|https://www.example.com/|class: primary&gt;&gt;


      -&gt; p

      becomes:


      -&gt; code
      &gt;&gt; html

      &lt;a href="https://www.example.com/" class="primary"&gt;charlie&lt;/a&gt;


      -&gt; list

      - Shorthands using backtics, underscores, etc... are in
      progress for code, strong, emphasis, etc... in addition
      to the ability to make them with the inline tags.

      - `-&gt; footnotes` section provide automatic numbering and links
      to places in the document marked by `^` characters. Those
      locations are numbered and link back in response.

      -|class: highlight| Attributes can be applied to individual list
      items by adding like on this line. Multiple attributes can
      be added like this: `-|id: alfa|class: bravo|-``

      - Ordered lists have their own `-&gt; olist` section type. Dashes
      are used instead of numbers to make it easier to move things
      without having to renumber them to look right in the source
      document. (Most processes disregard the numbers, but it
      always bugged my when they weren't right in the source.)

      - The start number of an ordered list can be defined with a
      `&gt;&gt; start: #`` attribute.

      - image handling is a work in progress.

      - table handling is a work in progress.

      - `-&gt; hidden`` for stuff that's in the file that you
      don't want output to the final content. (NOTE:
      don't rely on it for anything sensitive. Figure
      that at some point something might screw up and
      send it out.)

      - `-&gt; results` - the result of a code run. (Maybe
      rendered in a `&lt;samp&gt;`` tag)

      -&gt; h2

      Next Steps

      Most of the above is pretty well defined. The rest of this
      below is a little more fluid. Their ideas I expect I'll
      get to, but the priority is everything above.

      That said, here's what the more complete vision includes.

      -&gt; list

      - `dlist`` for description lists

      - `html`` section provide for raw HTML input

      - `div`` sections provide for adding content that's not
      wrapped in `&lt;p&gt;`` tags

      - `blockquote`` sections for blockquotes.

      - `css`` sections provide a way to add CSS directly
      to the page. (They are added as the last CSS before the closing
      `&lt;/head&gt;``.

      - `js`` sections provide a way to inject scripts directly
      into the page. (They are added as the last `&lt;script&gt;`` before
      the closing `&lt;/head&gt;``)

      - I have an idea for `DATA` sections to house data for
      a page, but TBD on that implementation. I need to work
      with it first.

      - `figure/figcaption` - TBD on these

      - `hr` for adding a horizontal rule you can style with
      attributes


      -&gt; p

      That's the basics.

      I'll post updates here as I make progress.

      And I stream some of the work &lt;&lt;link|on twitch|https://www.twitch.tv/theidofalan&gt;&gt;

      Stop by and say hi.
