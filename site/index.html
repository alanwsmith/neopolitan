      <h2> Overview</h2>
    
  
    
      <p> My  site  is  twenty  years  old.  Pondering  the  past  two  decades  started  me  thinking  about  the  next  two.  It  changed  my  perspective  on  making  and  maintaining  my  site  has  changed  because  of  it.  &quot;What  foundation  do  I  want  to  setup  for  the  next  two  decades?&quot;  is  a  very  different  question  from  &quot;What  do  I  want  to  do  for  my  next  redesign?&quot;  On  my  time  horizon,  the  key  isn&#x27;t  the  tech  stack.  It&#x27;s  the  content.</p>
    
  

    
    
    
    
  
    
      <h2> Post  Count</h2>
    
  
    
      <p> I&#x27;ve  moved  my  site  a  half  dozen  times.  Each  one  involved  a  painful  content  migration.  They&#x27;re  rarely  fun.  They&#x27;re  even  less  so  when  you&#x27;ve  crossed  a  thousand  posts.  I&#x27;m  at  1,566.</p>
    
  
    
      <p> I&#x27;ve  gone  from  raw  HTML  to  Wordpress  back  to  HTML  to  a  half  dozen  DB  schemas  to  Markdown  to  MDX  to  Org-Mode.  Every  approach  involves  friction  that  slows  me  down  both  from  making  posts  an  experimenting  with  my  site  on  a  larger  level.</p>
    
  
    
      <p> For  example:</p>

<h3> I&#x27;m  a  huge  fan  of  plain-text.  My  Grimoire  has  nine  thousand  Markdown,  MDX,  and  Org-Mode  files  in  it.  They&#x27;re  solid  formats,  but  each  causes  its  own  type  of  friction.  For  example,  I  don&#x27;t  use  description  lists  because  they  aren&#x27;t  native  to  the  MDX  parser  I&#x27;m  using.</h3>



<p> So,  I&#x27;m  making  my  own  format.</p>



    
    
    
    
  
    
      <h2> Neopolitan  Features</h2>
    
  
    
      <p> The  format  is  still  in  its  early  stages  and  very  much  in  flux.  That  said,  the  basic  ideas  are  mostly  in  place.</p>
    
  

    
    
    
    
<div 
      class="aside highlighted"
      id="firstAside"

    <p> There&#x27;s  a  bunch  of  code  samples  below.  The  format  is  more  about  text  content.  Parsing  through  collections  of  short  samples  took  me  a  little  getting  used  to.</p>

      <h2> Next  Steps</h2>
    
  
    
      <p> Most  of  the  above  is  pretty  well  defined.  The  rest  of  this  below  is  a  little  more  fluid.  Their  ideas  I  expect  I&#x27;ll  get  to,  but  the  priority  is  everything  above.</p>
