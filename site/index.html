-&gt; TITLE

Neopolitan 

-&gt; SUBTITLE

A plain-text document format for building web sites

-&gt; H2

Overview

None of the plain-text formats I've worked with fit 
what I'm looking for to manage the content for my 
site. It's time to see if I can make one I like. 

This document is a draft of notes and thinking about
the format. It'll change as I work with the format
in production. 

-&gt; H2 

Sections

Section start with a `-&gt;`lang:neo` followed by a 
keyword.  They generally map toward HTML tags. The 
`TITLE`` tag is an H1 that also shows up in the 
metadata for usage in the output. The 
`SUBTITLE`` becomes a div with the class subtitle 
one it. 

-H2

Paragraphs

Most text blocks turn into paragraphs. They start 
automatically after a `-&gt; TITLE`lang:neo`, 
`-&gt; SUBTITLE`lang:neo`, or `-&gt; H#`lang:neo` 
which each end after a single line of text. 

Blocks of paragraphs can also be started explicitly 
with the `-&gt; P`lang:neo` tag. In both cases the
content is wrapped in `&lt;p&gt;`lang:html` tags
in the output. 

-&gt; H2

Attributes

Attributes can be applied to any section by adding 
a `-&gt;`` token followed by the desired key/value pair 
(e.g.`-&gt; class: highlighted`lang:neo`).

The next paragraph in the source code is an example. 

-&gt; P
-&gt; class: highlighted

Not being able to apply styles and attributes to 
individual blocks without falling back to HTML is
one of the key reasons I'm making this format. 

-&gt; H2

Unordered Lists  

Unordered lists begin with the `LIST`` keyword. 
Right now there is no nesting. I rarely need that 
so I'll just fall back to HTML. I'll deal with it 
later if it becomes a big pain point. 

Here's a list that includes additional styles 
added to the second item. 

-&gt; LIST

- Alfa Bravo
-|class: extra|- Charlie Delta
- Echo Foxtrot

-&gt; H2

Ordered Lists

Lists with numbers start with `-&gt; OLIST`lang:neo`. 
Dashes are used instead of numbers. That comes 
from shuffling numbers back and forth. Numbering
is done automatically in the output and can be
adjusted to start at a specific number. 

-&gt; OLIST
-&gt; start: 3

- Alfa 
- Bravo
- Charlie 

-&gt; H2

Other stuff

Here's some other things that are still in flux

-&gt; H2

Attributes 

A base `-&gt; ATTRIBUTES`lang:neo` tag that holds key
value pairs. Any pair can be used in the output 
template or output file path. (e.g. `id`` is used
in the filename creation)


-&gt; H2

Inline Tags

Inline tags start and end with a pipe `|`lang:neo`  
character touching the internal content. The 
pipe is also used to separate the different
parts of the tag. Adding a `\\`lang:neo` in front
of a pipe escapes it so it can be used directly 
in the content. Adding a `\\`lang:neo` in front


-&gt; H2

Inline links

An &lt;&lt;link|inline link|https://www.example.com&gt;&gt;

A &lt;&lt;link|reference link|1&gt;&gt;

A &lt;&lt;link|styled link|2|class: highlight&gt;&gt;

-&gt; LINKS

1: https://www.example.com/

2: https://www.alanwsmith.com/

-&gt; P 

There's no change to the format between full links 
and reference links. Anything that matches a reference 
uses that reference. Otherwise it's put in as is. 

-&gt; H2

Images 

Inline images are done much like links. 

Sample: &lt;&lt;img|1|alt text|class: alfa&gt;&gt;

I expect most of the time they'll be done on their 
own lines, but they can be put directly in text
as shown above. If they are on their own line
they aren't wrapped in a paragraph. They sit
as siblings to the other content. 

-&gt; IMAGES  

1: https://placekitten.com/200/280

-&gt; H2 

Inline Code

Inline code is done with three backticks. The code
itself goes between the first two. Any attributes are
placed between the second and third. Some might have 
special processing (e.g. `lang``), anything that 
doesn't have special processing is passed directly 
to the HTML as attributes. 

Multiple attributes are separated by a `|``. For 
example:

-&gt; CODE 
-&gt; lang: neo 

`print("Hello, World")`lang: python|class: alfa`

-&gt; P

Spaces between the `:`` and value are optional. 

-&gt; H2

Other stuff part 2

-&gt; LIST 

- TODO - for to do lists

- DIV - for div wrappers instead of paragraphs

- HTML - for raw html 

- NOTES - a div wrapper with a `class: notes` 
pre applied 

- FOOTNOTES - auto numbered footnotes that 
link to their corresponding locations in the 
document

- DATA - has as `-&gt; lang: json`` tag. Doesn't 
show up in output. Is added in the document
template directly for use in scripts on the 
page. Need to think some about how this 
will get put in and if there should be more
than one of them. To start with, it'll
just be the one. (should allow for `-&gt; lang
js`` as well. 

- CODE EndOfCode Tags - for the times when 
other headers would otherwise brake a 
code block. 

- CSS - styles that are copied directly to 
the end of the page's style section to set 
things without having to adjust code. 

- BLOCKQUOTE - A blockquote. Maybe with an 
optional attribution. 

- QUOTE - For a quote and an attribution. 

- HIDDEN - Stuff that's in the file that you 
don't want output to the final content. (NOTE:
don't relay on it for anything sensitive. Figure
that at some point something might screw up and
send it out.) Might not even do the field 
since it could lead to that happening. 

- TABLES - still working on how to handle
these. Requirements include the ability to 
style individual cells while still making the 
content readable in the text file. 

- Spans - e.g. `&lt;&lt;span|asdf|class:alfa&gt;&gt;

- CATEGORIES - For identifying categories pages
apply to. 

- Strong and emphasis text - TBD on _text_, /text/
*text* - Thinking I want to have underline as
an option too. (beyond just strong and emphasis)

- DL, DT, and DD - Description lists and items 

- FIGURE and FIGCAPTION - For figures. 

- HR - Horizontal rules (tdb if three dashs (i.e.
`---``) will also make a rule or just be for
visible sectioning. Feels like it make the most
sense to start with the later. 

- &lt;&lt;cite&gt;&gt; - TBD on this one. 

- &lt;&lt;dfn&gt;&gt; - for wrapping a word that's being defined
in a defintion. (See the HTML spec for the example)

- &lt;&lt;kbd&gt;&gt; - Denote text entry. 

- &lt;&lt;mark&gt;&gt; - Represents text which is marked or 
highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to 
the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.

- &lt;&lt;ruby&gt;&gt; - TBD on this one. Need to play with it 
some. The MDN docs say: Represents small annotations 
that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, 
usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian 
characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds 
of text, but this usage is less common. Might be something
cool to do with it beyond the East Asian characters. 

- &lt;&lt;s&gt;&gt; - Strikethru. (Could also do `-stirkethru-``). 
Probably should be both. So you cany style it as well
if you want. Note that you'd want to be able to nest
strong, underline, emphasis and strike through both with
the text shorthand and with the tags. 

- RESULT - the resul of a code run. (Should probably be
rendred in a `&lt;samp&gt;`lang:html` tag. 

- &lt;&lt;sub&gt;&gt; - Specifies inline text which should 
be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. 
Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using 
smaller text.

- &lt;&lt;sup&gt;&gt; - Specifies inline text which is to be 
displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. 
Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using 
smaller text.

- &lt;&lt;var&gt;&gt; - Represents the name of a variable in 
a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's 
typically presented using an italicized version of the 
current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.

- TODO: Look at the rest of these:
