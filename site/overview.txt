Welcome To Neopolitan 

-> SUBTITLE

A plain-text format for websites

-> H2

Overview

My site is twenty years old. Realizing that, I
started thinking about the next twenty. Something
I'd never done before. It changes a lot. 

Generally speaking, I'll be writing vanilla HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript. More on that later. For now, 
it's enough to say that, for my personal site, 
frameworks have been a net negative. I'm going
back to the fundamentals. 

Content management caught my attention as well. 
I'm a huge fan of plain-text. Markdown, MDX, 
and Org-Mode all play a part in my system. 
They're solid, but they each cause their own 
type of friction. There are things I'm not 
doing because of them. 

So, I'm making my own format.

Neopolitan Features

Neopolitan is still in it's early stages 
and very much in flux. I'm using it in 
and iterative design style process. That said, 
the basic ideas are pretty well locked in. 

-> ASIDE 
>> class: highlighted

There's a bunch of code samples below that can 
get hard to look at in the raw form if you're not 
familiar with the format. The content above is 
more what my average posts look like. 


-> LIST

- This aim of neopolitan is not to be all things
to all people. It's initial goal is to build
my website. It's open source. I hope folks
find it useful in the future, but I'd 
hold off trying to do anything with it until
I've at least got it in production myself. 

- Neopolitan documents are composed of sections 
that start with a `->`` token followed by 
the name for the type of section. The type of 
section determines how the content is processed. 
For example, a `-> TITLE`` section turns the first
line after it into an `h1`` and the rest of 
the content after it becomes paragraphs.

- Optional attributes an be added to each section. 
via a token with two `>`` directly under the 
opening `->`` line. The `>> class: highlighted`` 
in the `-> ASIDE`` section above is an example. 

- Some sections are for display (like this 
`-> LIST``) while others are for metadata
(like the `-> ATTRIBUTES``, and `-> CATEGORIES`) 
below. 

- Different inline tags are available for links, 
code, spans, quotes, and others that will be 
documented. The tags start with two `<`` and end 
with two `>`` Here's a link as an example:

-> CODE 

<<link|alfa|https://www.example.com/>>

-> LIST

- Links can also use references. This is done using 
some name or number in the tag then adding the
same thing to a `-> LINKS` section somewhere in 
the document. For example:

-> CODE 

<<link|bravo|1>>

-> P

And then in a `-> LINKS` section: 

-> CODE 

1: https://www.example.com

-> LIST 

- Optional attributes can be passed to inline 
tags by separating them with a pipe. For example:

-> CODE 

<<link|charlie|https://www.example.com/|class: primary>>

-> P 

becomes:

-> CODE 

<a href="https://www.example.com/" class="primary">charlie</a>

-> LIST 

- Shorthands using backtics, underscores, etc... are in
progress for code, strong, emphasis, etc... in addition 
to the ability to make them with the inline tags. 

- `-> FOOTNOTES` section provide automatic numbering and links 
to places in the document marked by `^` characters. Those 
locations are numbered and link back in response. 

-class: highlight|- Attributes can be applied to individual list 
items by adding a second `-` and putting the attributes inside 
pipes like this one. Multiple pipes work too. 
`-|id: alfa|class: bravo|-`

- Ordered lists have their own `-> OLIST` section type. Dashes
are used instead of numbers to make it easier to move things 
without having to renumber them to look right in the source 
document. (Most processes disregard the numbers, but it 
always bugged my when they weren't right in the source.)

- The start number of an ordered list can be defined with a 
`>> start: #`` attribute. 

- Image handling is a work in progress. 

- Table handling is a work in progress. 

- `-> HIDDEN`` for stuff that's in the file that you 
don't want output to the final content. (NOTE:
don't rely on it for anything sensitive. Figure
that at some point something might screw up and
send it out.) 

- `-> RESULT` - the result of a code run. (Maybe
rendered in a `<samp>`` tag)

-> H2

Next Steps

Most of the above is pretty well defined. The rest of this 
below is a little more fluid. Their ideas I expect I'll 
get to, but the priority is everything above. 

That said, here's what a more complete vision includes. 

-> LIST

- `DLIST` for description lists

- `HTML`` section provide for raw HTML input

- `DIV`` sections provide for adding content that's not 
wrapped in `<p>`` tags

- `BLOCKQUOTE`` sections for blockquotes. 

- `CSS`` sections provide a way to add CSS directly 
to the page. (They are added as the last CSS before the closing 
`</head>``.

- `JS`` sections provide a way to inject scripts directly 
into the page. (They are added as the last `<script>`` before 
the closing `</head>``)

- I have an idea for `DATA` sections to house data for 
a page, but TBD on that implementation. I need to work 
with it first. 

- `FIGURE/FIGCAPTION` - TBD on these

- `HR` for adding a horizontal rule you can style with 
attributes 


-> P 

That's the basics. This is my first time doing something
like this so I have no idea how long it'll take. I've 
started making some actual progress on a parser though. 
So, I'm optimistic. 

I'll post updates here as I make progress.
