  A plain-text website format
</div>
<div class="note"><p>These are some draft notes for the home page and the rest of the site</p></div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My site is twenty years old. Pondering those past two decades got me thinking about the next two. It changed my approach to making and maintaining my site. "What foundation do I want for the next two decades?" is a very different question from "What do I want to do for my next redesign?"</p>
<p>On that time horizon, my thoughts don't go to the tech, they go to the content.</p>
<h2>Post Count</h2>
<p>I've moved my site a half dozen times. Each one involved a painful content migration. I've gone from raw HTML to Perl scripts to Wordpress to PHP with various DB schemas to Markdown to MDX to Org-Mode to a mix of all of the above. After switching to plain-text with Markdown I'm not interested in anything else. But, those formats don't work for me. I keep running into frictions that keep me from posting the way I'd like.</p>
<p>So, I'm making my own format. It's called Neopolitan.</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>The general idea is to use sections (which start with a <code>-></code> token) to define areas of content. The type of section defines how the content inside it will behave.</p>
<p>These are the section types I'm planning along with indications of which ones are already set.</p>


<h3> Inline  Tags</h3>



<p> Most  of  the  section  types  hold  text  content.  That  text  content  is  split  into  <p>  tags  by  default  and  the  text  inside  of  them  is  parsed  for  inline  tags  and  shorthand  codes.  Inline  tags  start  with  two  <<  and  end  with  a  closing  >>  set.  Here's  the  list  with  x  indicating  the  ones  that  are  implemented  and  .  indicating  that  are  still  under  consideration.  (This  is  basically  the  list  of  html  elements)</p>

<p>
  Neopolitan
</p>

<p>
  Here's what I'm thinking
</p>


<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Focused on text based content
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Plain-text
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      White-space is not meaningful except for using blank lines between sections and blocks
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      A variety of section types
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Individual sections for metadata
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Arbitrary attributes can be added to sections including code blocks.
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Arbitrary attributes can be added to inline tags
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      A collection of sections and inline tags that provides all <a href="
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html">standard HTML elements</a>
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      The spec defines the AST, not the final output. That's left up to the rendering engine.
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Footnotes
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      References
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Result blocks in addition to code blocks (with the goal of getting my editor to generate them automatically like Org-Mode)
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>

<h2>Under Consideration</h2>
<p>Some other things I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      A <code>widget</code> section type that's used to pass data to the rendered page (via whatever method the implementation - A <code>css</code> section type designed to include CSS that should be added as the last <code><style></code> tag in the <code><head></code> of the document
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      A <code>script</code><script></script>`html` in the head of the document
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Includes sections that include other files
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>


<p>
  Every approach involves friction that slows me down both from making posts an experimenting with my site on a larger level.
</p>

<p>
  For example:
</p>


<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      a b
    </p>
    
    <p>
      cd
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      e f
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>


<p>
  I don't know all the different ways I'll build my side over the next two decades, but I know the
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  The first examination is the code. I'm switching to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There's a lot to be written about that later. For now, suffice it to say that, for my personal site, frameworks have been a net negative for me. I'm bowing out of that game.
</p>




<h3> Plain-text</h3>



<p>  I'm  a  huge  fan  of  plain-text.  My  Grimoire  has  nine  thousand  Markdown,  MDX,  and  Org-Mode  files  in  it.  They're  solid  formats,  but  each  causes  its  own  type  of  friction.  For  example,  I  don't  use  description  lists  because  they  aren't  native  to  the  MDX  parser  I'm  using.</p>



<p> So,  I'm  making  my  own  format.</p>



<h2>Neopolitan Features</h2>
<p>The format is still in its early stages and very much in flux. That said, the basic ideas are mostly in place.</p><aside id="firstAside" class="highlighted"><p>There's a bunch of code samples below. The format is more about text content. Parsing through collections of short samples took me a little getting used to.</p></aside>
<h2>Samples</h2>
<p>Below are some samples that will be overwritten when the actual content.</p>
<pre><code class="
  
  language-rust"
>this is a test with code

and some more code</code></pre>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Most of the above is pretty well defined. The rest of this below is a little more fluid. Their ideas I expect I'll get to, but the priority is everything above.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>This is a test list</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      a - b
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      c
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>


<p>
  and that's the end of the list
</p>




<h3> Other  ideas</h3>



<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      An `-> og` tag to put in open graph values? Need to thing about how that would work.
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>


<p>
  Holding (attributes aren't being parsed yet so this is hacked out)
