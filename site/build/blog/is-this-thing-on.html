  <main><h1 class="title">Is This Thing On?</h1><h2>An Alternative</h2><p>You're suppose to use "Hello, World" for the 
title of the first post on a new site. I figure 
that's been done enough. So, we're changing it up
and going with "Is this thing on?"</p><h2>Bare Bones</h2><p>And, yes. This thing is on.</p><p>I'm doing the Launch-Before-You're-Ready and
Build-In-Public thing. Everything on this site 
is built with Neopolitan documents and the
example site generator I'm building. That means
things are going to be sparse at the start. I really 
like the approach though.</p><p>There's nothing like using something
you're building to help you find the sharp edges.</p><h2>A Doodad</h2><p>The overview of the format and why I'm 
creating it are on the <a href="/">home page</a> . I won't 
rehash them here. In fact, this post is going
to be very short. It's purpose is primarily 
to give me content to work with as I continue
progress on the format and the engine.</p><p>The <a href="/blog/considering-bookmarks.html">next post</a>  on 
bookmarks actually has something to say.</p><p>-a</p><h3 class="blog-footer">Next Up</h3><p><a href="/blog/considering-bookmarks.html">Considering Bookmarks</a></p></main>
