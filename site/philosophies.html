  Neopoliltan Philosophies
</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>These are the thoughts, influences, and decisions that lead to neopolitan&#x27;s design.</p>
<h2>The Philosophies</h2>


<h3> HTML  Focused</h3>



<p> My  primary  output  target  is  HTML.  Most  HTML  tags  have  native  counterparts  to  support  that.  This  largely  stems  from  the  fact  that  I  want  to  use  description  lists  but  those  aren&#x27;t  included  in  the  default  markdown  I  use.</p>





<h4> AST  Over  Output</h4>



<p> This  project  can  be  broken  into  two  parts:</p>



<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      The format and the AST
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      The output
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>


<p>
  The specification only deals with the AST and the output. The project includes and example output renderer but based on what I&#x27;ve seen with Markdown trying to define an implementation via a spec isn&#x27;t likely to work out well.

<h3> Raw  Text  In  The  AST</h3>



<p> I&#x27;m  not  doing  an  convertion  for  HTML  escaping  in  the  process  that  makes  the  AST.  I&#x27;m  leaving  that  to  the  output  processor.  That&#x27;s  an  implementation  detail,  but  I  prefer  splitting  the  two  that  way.</p>





<h3> Footnotes  And  References</h3>



<p> Use  the  first  line  after  them  as  the  name  which  is  what&#x27;s  tied  into  the  key  from  the  content.  (e.g.  &gt;&gt; Some Name  connects  to  `&lt;&lt;^  Some  Name  &gt;&gt;`.  Surrounding  white  space  is  trimmed.  Internal  spaces  are  allowed  but  must  match  as  the  value  is  used  as  a  direct  key.</p>





<h3> Insignificant  Whitespace</h3>



<p> It  doesn&#x27;t  matter  in  most  places  except  for:</p>



<ul>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Blank lines that act as separators between sections and list items
    </p>
    </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Key names in footnotes and references
    </p>
    </li>
  
</ul>



<h3> Section  Types</h3>



<p> There  are  different  types  of  sections:</p>



<p> -  Basic  Processed  Content  (e.g.  -&gt; p )</p>



<p> -  List  Processed  Content  (e.g.  -&gt; list )</p>



<p> -  Raw  Content  (e.g.  -&gt; code )</p>



<p> -  Metadata  Driven  content  (e.g.  -&gt; youtube )</p>



<p> -  Basic  Metadata  (e.g.  -&gt; attributes )</p>



<p> -  Custom  sections  (e.g.  -&gt; wc  and  -&gt; c )</p>





<h3> Everything  is  a  string</h3>



<p> There&#x27;s  no  attempt  in  the  AST  to  convert  to  numbers.  Everything  is  a  string.</p>





<h3> Attributes  Are  Key  Values  By  Default</h3>



<p> The  attributes  section  of  my  implementation  contains  only  key&#x2f;value  pairs.  The  AST  leave  the  option  of  using  other  formats  in  the  content  section  as  well.</p>





<h3> No  Form  Section</h3>



<p> I  was  considering  a  -&gt; form  section  but  decided  against  it.  Better  to  just  roll  out  to  an  `-&gt;  html`  section  for  that  based  of  the  complexity.</p>





<h3> No  iFrame  Section</h3>



<p> Just  roll  out  to  `-&gt;  html`</p>
