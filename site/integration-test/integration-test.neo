get for Neopolitan. Any parser that renders 
it with the same output is considered valid.

`<div class="neo-example"></div>` tags

## Whitespace And Scope

Whitespace doesn't matter except when it
does. (e.g. `---: PRE` sections). 

This document does not aim to test edge 
cases and variations. See the <<l|1|unit 
tests>> for that.

---: NOTE

This is a note which means it is wrapped in a div



---: TODO
:::: :id main-todo
:::: :class sierra tango 

[] Put in the actual link to unit tests 
when the location has been determined.
