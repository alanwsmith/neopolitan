# neopolitan

A parser for the neopolitan format. 

## Overview

Neopolitan is a plain-text format 
in the spirit of markdown, but with
more features. I designed it for
managing the content on 
[my site](https://www.alanwsmith.com/). 

## Notes

- TODO: Split out from 
[Neopoligen](https://www.neopoligen.com/)
builder and make neopolitan it's
own crate.
