[] Setup so you can put links directly in the 
<<<link>>> tags. It's probably gonna be a 95/5
thing where if it's a number you use the array
reference and if not you do it directly. That
would fall down with a relative link starting
with a number but in that case a <<code|./>>
can be used in front of it. 

[] Setup for more than just english
